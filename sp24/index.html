<!-- Intro -->
<div class="container sec" id="intro">
    <p>
        As a critical component of Human-Computer Interaction, conversational user interfaces (CUIs) can potentially revolutionize the way we interact with technology. This course is designed for graduate students who want to gain a deeper understanding of CUIs and their real-world applications. Throughout the course, we will explore cutting-edge research and methodologies for designing, implementing, and evaluating CUIs. Various topics of conversational interfaces will be covered, including design principles, evaluation, human agency, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
        Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (EN.601.490/690), at least one graduate-level computer science course in Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning
        (including NLP, Computer Vision, etc.) is preferred, or permission of the instructor.
        Students must be comfortable reading recent research papers and discussing key concepts and ideas.

            <li><b>Classes:</b> on Monday/Wednesday 15:00 - 16:30 pm EST (Hodson 211)</li>
            <li><b>Office hours:</b>
                Ziang: Tuesday 4-5pm Malone 309</li>
            <li><b>Class Structure</b>: The class will be in-person. Each session will primarily involve small-group discussions 
                of recent or highly impactful papers on Conversational AI. Students will also complete a course project in a group of 2-3 students.
            </li>
            <li><b>Piazza</b>: Please join the class Piazza <a href="">TBA</a>
            </li>
            <li><b>Coursework:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Readings (~2 papers) for each class period.</li>
                <li>A short (2-paragraph) written response to the readings is to be posted on Piazza by 12 pm on the day of the class. These responses
                    should raise questions appropriate for discussion or propose ideas to think about.</li>
                <li>Presenter: Everyone will be the lead discussant in their discussion groups at least two times over the semester. Starting from week 2, there will be one presenter for each reading. Each presenter should give a 10-min presentation with two parts, a short (5-min) summary and a short (5-min) disucssion starter (5-min). For the discussion starter, you could put your reviewer hat on to critique the paper, being a visionary to propose an imaginary follow-up research project or a new application, or an empiricist to situate the paper in real-world contexts.</li>
                <li> Lead Discussant: The main purpose of the class is to create a stimulating environment in which to share and critique ideas. The class will randomly split into a few groups and you will share your critical ideas/critiques/experiences on the topic. Everyone will be the lead discussant in their discussion groups at several times over the semester. The lead discussants should have read all the readings and the response paragraphs. They will lead and organize the discussion in their group and synthesize for reporting back to the whole class.
                </li>
                <li>A final project (in a group of 2-3 students). This can be a system paper (e.g., a novel system you built with a usability study), a study paper (e.g., an experiment that reveals people's behavioral patterns), an analytic paper (e.g., evaluating or auditing existing systems), etc. [Your idea should not be limited by the format. We can discuss if you prefer a different format.]
